  <h1> The History of the Cold war </h1>
    <p> by Wyatt </p>


  <h2> What is it?</h2>
  <p> <strong> The Cold War </strong> was a decades-long global geopolitical rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, lasting from the end of World War II in 1945 until the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991</p>

The Cold War, spanning from the end of World War II in 1945 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, was a prolonged period of geopolitical tension between the United States and its Western allies on one side, and the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc partners on the other. Rather than direct military confrontation between the superpowers, the conflict manifested through ideological rivalry—democracy and capitalism versus communism and authoritarianism—fueled by mutual distrust and the race for global influence. Key triggers included the division of Europe into spheres of influence, symbolized by the Iron Curtain that Winston Churchill famously described in 1946, and events like the 1948-1949 Berlin Blockade, where the Soviets attempted to starve West Berlin into submission, only to be thwarted by the U.S.-led Berlin Airlift. This era saw the formation of opposing alliances, such as NATO in 1949 and the Warsaw Pact in 1955, which locked in a bipolar world order.

The Cold War's intensity peaked during flashpoints like the Korean War (1950-1953) and the Vietnam War (1955-1975), where proxy battles allowed the superpowers to test each other's resolve without risking nuclear annihilation. The arms race escalated dramatically, with both sides amassing thousands of nuclear warheads, leading to the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) that deterred all-out war but cast a shadow of existential fear. Cultural and technological competitions, including the Space Race—highlighted by the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 and the U.S. moon landing in 1969—further underscored the rivalry. Détente in the 1970s brought temporary easing through arms control treaties like SALT I, but renewed tensions under leaders like Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev defined the 1980s. The Cold War ultimately unraveled with Gorbachev's reforms of glasnost and perestroika, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the Soviet collapse in 1991, marking the triumph of liberal democracy and the end of a divided world.</p>
